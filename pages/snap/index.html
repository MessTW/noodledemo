<!--
 The key is to divide the image into multiple layers, each containing only gfx for a specific depth, see the individual images. Just brush off more and more of the deeper gfx for every layer. This, combined with the card rotation gives that subtle 3D effect.

The background and border are slightly rotated at the x-axis, so they cover the bottom and are behind the top of the layers.
